# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart programming and shows how to fix it. The `bug.dart` file contains code with improper exception handling in a `Future`, leading to potential silent failures.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with more robust error handling.
